# EmbeddedRecord [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/wojtekmach/embedded_record.png)](http://travis-ci.org/wojtekmach/embedded_record)

* http://github.com/wojtekmach/embedded_record

## DESCRIPTION:

EmbeddedRecord is designed to do two things:

* Define records on a Class
* Embed one or many records (similiar to belongs\_to and
has\_and\_belongs\_to\_many associations)
* See example Rails app:
  [EmbeddedRecordExample](https://github.com/wojtekmach/embedded_record_example)

## SYNOPSIS:

Basic embeddable record usage:

```ruby
class Color
  include EmbeddedRecord::Record
  attribute :id, Symbol
  attribute :name, String
  attribute :hex, String

  record :red,   :name => "Red",   :hex => "#FF0000"
  record :green, :name => "Green", :hex => "#00FF00"
  record :blue,  :name => "Blue",  :hex => "#0000FF"
end

p Color.ids # => [:red, :green, :blue]
p Color.all # => [#<Color>, #<Color>, #<Color>]
p Color.attribute_names # => [:id, :name, :hex]
Color.first
Color.last

blue = Color.find(:blue)
p blue.id    # => :blue

p blue.index # => 2
p blue.name  # => "Blue"
p blue.hex   # => "#0000FF"

p blue.is?(:red) # false
```

Embedding record:

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :color_mask # integer id of a record
  include EmbeddedRecord
  embed_record :color
end

car = Car.new
car.color_id = :red
p car.color_mask # => 0
p car.color.name # => "Red"
```

Embedding records:

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :colors_mask # integer bitmask of record ids
  include EmbeddedRecord
  embed_records :colors
end

car = Car.new
car.color_ids = [:red, :green]
p car.colors.first.name # => "Red"
p car.color_ids         # => [:red, :green]
p car.colors_mask       # => 3 (2**0 + 2**1)
```

NullObject support:

```ruby
class Color
  record nil, :name => "Blank"
end

Color.ids # => [:red, :green, :blue] # still the same

Car.new.color.name # => "Blank" # No whiny nils!
```
